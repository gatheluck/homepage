                  >ExaWizards Inc.</a
                >, where, as a 12Ã—AWS-Certified engineer, I spearhead the Cloud
                Enabling Guild, driving the seamless transition from
                proof-of-concept prototypes to robust, scalable machine learning
                services. In my role within the CTO office, I actively shape our
                overarching technology strategy to ensure that innovation aligns
                with our business objectives. With a dual background as both a
                researcher and an engineer, I am dedicated to rapidly
                transforming cutting-edge research into practical solutions that
                deliver meaningful, real-world impact.
