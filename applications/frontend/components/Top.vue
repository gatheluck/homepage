                  >ExaWizards Inc.</a
                >, where I spearhead the Cloud Enabling Guild, driving the
                seamless transition from proof-of-concept prototypes to robust,
                scalable machine learning services. In my role within the CTO
                office, I actively shape our overarching technology strategy to
                ensure that innovation aligns with our business objectives. With
                a dual background as both a researcher and an engineer, I am
                dedicated to rapidly transforming cutting-edge research into
                practical solutions that deliver meaningful, real-world impact.
